## How to use Github Desktop.

We use Github Desktop for version control, allowing you to organize your strategies and share them with us. The following steps should help you set it up. 

#### Installing Github Desktop
1. [Download](https://desktop.github.com/) and install Github Desktop.
2. Go to [Github.com](https://github.com) and navigate to the repository you want to work on.
3. Click the green 'Code' button, and copy the URL you see.
4. Open the Github Desktop client and go to `File > Clone Repository`.
5. Click the URL tab, paste in the URL, select a destination folder on your machine and click 'Clone'.
6. Now that you have the repository folder locally on your machine, any change that you make in that folder will be noted by Github Desktop.

#### Using Github Desktop
1. Commit your work regularly. Committing is 'saving' the current state of your folder. You can commit by typing a commit message (i.e. what did you change) in the bottom left panel of Github Desktop and press 'Commit'. 
2. Now that you have committed your changes, you want to 'Push' the commit to the repository. This synchronizes the repository with your changes. Click the 'Push' button in the top middle.   

You should now have Github Desktop up and running!
