# Installing and getting started
There are multiple ways to run our Backtesting Engine. For each way, the installation steps are
outlined on separate pages. The pages are outlined below. 
    
***

### [Getting started with Docker (any platform)](https://docs.dematrading.ai/getting_started/running/running_docker)
### [Getting started for MacOS / Linux](https://docs.dematrading.ai/getting_started/installation/mac_os)
### [Getting started for Windows](https://docs.dematrading.ai/getting_started/installation/windows)

!!! attention 
    Are you running on an MacOS machine with a M1 processor?
    M1 processors need another approach. Please visit [this page](https://docs.dematrading.ai/getting_started/installation/mac_os_m1) if you have a M1 chip.


!!! note 
    Currently, we recommend to use Docker for running our Engine.
    If you are not familiar with Docker, please use the normal way of installing and running.

    Running without Docker? You will have to manually download the repository on your computer.
