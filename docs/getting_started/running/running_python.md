# Running the Engine with Python

!!! note "" 
    Running our engine with Python is not recommended. Only run it with Python when lacking knowledge of Docker. Please have a look [here](https://docs.dematrading.ai/getting_started/running/running_docker) for running it with Docker.
    
1. First of all; it is important to have our repository downloaded and unzipped.
2. Open the directory with the newly downloaded files. 
3. Install all the required packages
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Now you can run the Engine by performing the following command: 
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   
!!! attention Running without Docker? You will have to manually download the repository on your computer.
    This can be done by [downloading the zip file](https://github.com/dema-trading-ai/engine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
    or by [cloning the engine](https://github.com/dema-trading-ai/engine) using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
    (or something similar).
