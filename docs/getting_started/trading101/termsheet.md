## ROI

Return On Investment (ROI) is widely known in cryptocurrency, it is a ratio or percentage value that represents profitability or efficiency of a certain trade or agreement. It is a tool that's widely used - including strategies for DemaTrading. ROI can be portrayed in an absolute ratio (such as 0.35) or a value percentage (such as 35%). The calculation for ROI is as followed:

```python
ROI = (Current Value - Total Cost) / Total Cost
```

A simple example would be as followed:

Mary bought 100 BTC at a price of 1,000 USD, paying 10 dollars for each BTC. If the current price of BTC is 20 dollars, Mary would have reached an ROI of 1.00 or 100%.

However, there are some limitations to ROI in itself as it does not take time in consideration. This means the efficiency is lower than it should be if a lot of time passes in comparison to an earlier timeslot. Let's show you via the hands of a quick example, using Mary again!

Mary's BTC is worth 18 per BTC after 6 months of her initial investment of 1,000 USD (100 BTC). She waits another 6 months for a total of 12 months, causing the BTC to be worth 19 USD per BTC after the 12 months. During this period there were ups and downs, and thus a second trade could have made Mary more money if she had traded at the 6 month mark; the time lost along with the fact she could've traded yet again lowering the efficiency. 

## Stop Loss

A Stop-Loss is an advanced order that is used by traders that limits any form of additional losses. When a specific price is met, the order is triggered.

An example would be that buying in at 100 would stop any form of losses at 95. In this case the stop-loss treshold would be -5%. Similarly, it can be done for a profit where one can set it to +5%, which in turn would mean the profit would be capped at 105.
