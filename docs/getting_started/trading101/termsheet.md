## ROI

Return On Investment (ROI) is widely known in cryptocurrency, it is a ratio or percentage value that represents profitability or efficiency of a certain trade or agreement. It is a tool that's widely used - including strategies for DemaTrading. ROI can be portrayed in an absolute ratio (such as 0.35) or a value percentage (such as 35%). The calculation for ROI is as followed:

```python
ROI = (Current Value - Total Cost) / Total Cost
```

A simple example would be as followed:

Mary bought 100 BTC at a price of 1,000 USD, paying 10 dollars for each BTC. If the current price of BTC is 20 dollars, Mary would have reached an ROI of 1.00 or 100%.

However, there are some limitations to ROI in itself
