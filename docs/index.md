# Contest

DemaTrading.ai is launching it’s very own bot contest! There are prizes to be won, battles to be fought, and we’re excited to see every single one of you participate. The contest will last from the 18th of May till the 31st of May - ending at exactly 23:59. During June, we’ll run the bots and the three bots that perform the best will be the ones to win some amazing prizes:

- 1st place: 300 Euro cash
- 2nd place: 200 Euro cash
- 3rd place: 100 Euro cash

Prerequisites:

- An algorithm supplier contract has to be signed before the 7th of June
- Submission is through Github. (An easy way for this would be [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com_))
- The bots are scored based on their performance in June, the score is calculated as profit / seen_drawdown in the Engine
- Only bots that are made in the Engine can participate.



Only bot names will be posted to keep everything anonymous to ensure a fair competition.

# Introduction

The DemaTrading.ai Engine is an open source backtesting Engine for trading as a part of [DemaTrading](https://DemaTrading.ai). The Engine is completely made in the programming language Python ([click here to download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

`Some Python experience makes this process easier, however with some extra effort this project should be runnable for anyone without any coding experience.`
