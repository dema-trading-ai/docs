# Introduction

The DemaTrading.ai Engine is an open source backtesting Engine for cryptocurrency trading as a part of
[DemaTrading](https://DemaTrading.ai). The Engine is completely written in the programming language Python
([click here to download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

`Some experience with Python makes this process easier, however with some effort this project should be runnable for 
everyone, no matter your experience with coding.`
