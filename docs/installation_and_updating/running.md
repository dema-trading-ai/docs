# Running

Once you have successfully installed the engine, it is time to run it. Open a terminal (MacOS) or Powershell (with
administrator rights) (Windows), and execute the following commands.

To create your project in a new folder, use the following command:
```
engine init <YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME>
```

Move to the directory you just created with the following command:
```
cd <YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME>
```

Then, to run the engine, simply execute the following command:
```
engine
```

Once you have done so, the Engine will run with a sample strategy. The results of the backtest will appear on your
screen. A detailed explanation of the results can be found in
[Section 2.3: Results explained](/your_first_strategy/results_explained).
