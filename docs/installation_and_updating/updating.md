# Updating
The Engine is updated regularly. For optimal performance make sure you are running the newest version of the Engine. With
the newest version, you’re always up-to-date! When an update is available, and you run the Engine using the commands
explained in the previous section, it will notify you in the terminal with a message similar to this:
```
[WARNING] Update available v0.7.7 → v0.7.9
```

This means that you are running an outdated version of the Engine. You can simply update the Engine by re-using the
commands you used when installing the Engine, as found in
[Section 1.1: Installation](/installation_and_updating/installation).
